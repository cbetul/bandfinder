# BandFinder


## Project Purpose and Target

The aim of this project is to build a web app to allow users login with credentials and offering some operations such as listing their accounts, viewing its details and posting adverts for finding a band member. Basically it is a social media, users can post ads according to the criteria they are looking for and other users can comments under the posts. It is able to edit and delete comments/posts. Also, there is a section that users can list all postings by desired specifications. I used **Python Flask and MySQL** for development.
